5. Change the about us text once more to:
Our work began during a period of reassessment. For several years, my focus was almost exclusively on financial performance and materialistic life. It delivered results for a time, but at what cost? I had deprioritized nearly every other area of my life - relationships, long-term direction, emotional poise, and inner peace.


During this period, I also began experiencing persistent anxiety and frequent migraines. The symptoms were disruptive and difficult to ignore. What stood out was not just their intensity, but how closely they tracked with prolonged stress, overexertion, and a lack of regulation.


Concurrently, the decline of my love life highlighted the consequences of self-neglect. Adrift both personally and professionally, my health deteriorated. Sleepless nights became routine, dominated by a constant sense of defeat. It was in that fragile space that I met Olga - a person who became one of the most meaningful connections in my life. She introduced me to the Sadhu board practice. At first, the idea of willingly standing on nails felt absurd. But her guidance completely changed my life.


Imagine understanding the deepest depths of your emotions, all meanwhile training your nervous system to stay regulated. One realization was that my life never really felt like mine. My reality felt molded by external forces which my nervous system turned into unresolved internal battles. Suddenly I recognized the patterns, habits, and thoughts that needed an update in order to live life as myself. Since childhood I’ve felt a calling to make a tangible human impact—and what better way to do that than through the very thing that transformed both my physical and mental health. I’ll never forget the morning I woke up feeling fully rested after months of insomnia. It’s been a bitter sweet recognizing the disconnect and overwhelm in others. I hope you too will find stillness and calm through Sadhu.

Sadhu Meditation Guide vs. 1:1 Guidance


What is the difference between a group class and a 1:1 guided session?
* Group classes focus on shared structure, collective energy, and guided self-regulation. You are responsible for listening to your body and pacing yourself.

* 1:1 classes are fully personalized. Guidance is adapted in real time based on your nervous system response, experience level, and goals.


Who should choose a group class?
Group classes are best for participants who:
   * Are comfortable practicing independently with verbal guidance

   * Can self-regulate discomfort without external intervention

   * Want consistency, structure, and community energy

   * Are looking for a lower-commitment, repeatable practice

If you need constant reassurance or moment-to-moment correction, group is not for you yet.




Who should choose a 1:1 guided class?
1:1 class are recommended if you:
      * Are brand new and want individualized pacing

      * Experience high anxiety, emotional reactivity, or nervous system sensitivity

      * Are working through specific blocks (stress, confidence, emotional release)

      * Want deeper integration rather than repetition

This is not “VIP for ego.” It’s precision for nervous system safety.


Is 1:1 safer than group practice?
Neither is inherently unsafe.
However:
         * 1:1 allows faster intervention and tighter containment

         * Group classes assume a baseline ability to self-regulate

If safety is a concern, start with 1:1. Don’t gamble with your nervous system to save money.


Can beginners join group classes?
Yes—but only if they:
            * Follow instructions exactly

            * Stay within their limits

            * Accept that discomfort is part of the process

Beginners who override their limits are the ones who struggle—not because of Sadhu, but because of poor self-trust.


Can I switch between group classes and 1:1 classes?
Yes, and that’s often ideal.
Common paths:
               * Start with 1:1 → transition into group

               * Use group classes for consistency → book 1:1 when stuck

               * Alternate during periods of high stress or transition

This is training, not a loyalty contract.


Will I get personal attention in a group class?
You will receive general guidance, not individualized correction.
Group classes are designed to:
                  * Teach self-awareness

                  * Build internal listening

                  * Strengthen autonomy

If you want someone tracking your every response, book 1:1.Are the practices different in group vs. 1:1?
The foundation is the same.
What changes is:
                     * Pacing

                     * Verbal cues

                     * Depth of inquiry

                     * Time spent integrating sensations and emotions

1:1 goes deeper. Group goes wider.










                        17. The question:Are there any contraindications? Change to:
           Are there people who should not practice Sadhu board at all?
           Yes. Sadhu is a powerful nervous-system and pressure-based practice. It is not appropriate for everyone, and ignoring contraindications is reckless—not brave. Below is a clear breakdown of absolute contraindications (do not practice) and conditions that require medical clearance and informed discussion before even considering it.


Do NOT use a Sadhu board if you have any of the following
These are non-negotiable contraindications:
Circulatory & Blood Conditions
                        * Peripheral neuropathy (reduced sensation in feet or body)

                        * Severe varicose veins or venous insufficiency

                        * Blood clotting disorders (e.g., hemophilia)

                        * Use of blood thinners (e.g., warfarin, DOACs)

                        * Severe anemia
Skin & Tissue Integrity Issues
                           * Open wounds, ulcers, cuts, blisters, or infections

                           * Diabetic foot complications

                           * Severe eczema, psoriasis, or skin fragility

                           * Recent surgical incisions or unhealed scars


Neurological Conditions
                              * Epilepsy or seizure disorders

                              * Advanced multiple sclerosis

                              * Parkinson’s disease with balance impairment

                              * Loss of pain perception or altered sensory processing
Orthopedic & Structural Issues
                                 * Recent fractures or joint surgery

                                 * Severe arthritis in feet, ankles, knees, hips, or spine

                                 * Osteoporosis or brittle bone disease

                                 * Spinal instability or disc herniation (especially for back/laying sessions)
Severe Cardiovascular Conditions
                                    * Uncontrolled high blood pressure

                                    * Recent heart attack or stroke

                                    * Unstable heart conditions
Conditions that REQUIRE medical clearance & informed discussion
These do not automatically disqualify someone, but must be discussed with a qualified medical professional first.
Pregnancy & Postpartum
                                       * Pregnancy (any trimester)

                                       * Early postpartum recovery

Considerations: Hormonal shifts, blood pressure changes, ligament laxity, and fetal safety. Sadhu is not recommended without explicit medical approval, and many practitioners advise avoiding it entirely during pregnancy.
Metabolic & Endocrine Conditions
                                          * Diabetes (especially with any neuropathy)

                                          * Thyroid disorders (if poorly regulated)

                                          * Autoimmune conditions during active flare-ups
Medications That Affect Sensation or Stress Response
                                             * Painkillers or opioids

                                             * Strong anti-anxiety or sedative medications

                                             * Medications affecting blood pressure or heart rate








                                                18. Recording and Privacy FAQ change
Are Sadhu classes recorded?
A: No. Sadhu classes are never recorded. All sessions are live and private to protect participant confidentiality, nervous system safety, and the integrity of the practice.
Why don’t you record Sadhu classes?
A: Sadhu involves personal physical and emotional experiences that deserve privacy and presence, not replay. Recording can inhibit honest self-regulation and compromise the psychological safety of the group.
 Is my privacy protected during group classes?
A: Yes. We value privacy as a core principle. Classes are conducted in a controlled online environment, and participants are not required to share personal information, speak, or appear on camera unless they choose to.
Can participants record the classes for personal use?
A: No. Participants are not permitted to record classes in any form, including audio, video, screen capture, or third-party software. This protects the privacy of all participants and the integrity of the class.
Why are participant recordings not allowed?
A: Recording alters behavior, increases self-consciousness, and can compromise emotional safety. Sadhu is a live, embodied practice—not content to be consumed later.
What happens if someone records a class without permission?
A: Unauthorized recording is a violation of class terms and may result in immediate removal from the session and loss of future access, without refund.
Do I have to turn my camera on during class?
A: No. Camera use is optional unless otherwise stated. You are encouraged to participate in a way that feels safe and regulated for your nervous system.
Is anything I share during class shared outside the session?
A: No. What occurs in class stays in class. We do not collect, store, or distribute personal session data or participant experiences.
Are classes monitored or observed by third parties?
A: No. Classes are facilitated only by the guide leading the session. There are no observers, reviewers, or third-party access.




                                                19. Logistics & Commitment
Change all questions to:
Do I need to own my own Sadhu board to participate in classes?
A: Yes. Owning your own Sadhu board is required to participate in Sadhu classes. This practice is built on consistency, personal responsibility, and nervous system awareness, which cannot be achieved reliably without your own board.


Why can’t I use a borrowed or shared board regularly?
A: Regularly borrowing or sharing a board undermines safety and progression. Even when sanitized, shared boards:
                                                * Disrupt sensory consistency

                                                * Increase wear-related variability

                                                * Make it difficult to track adaptation and limits

Sadhu requires a stable baseline. Ownership provides that.


Is sharing a Sadhu board ever acceptable?
A: Occasional sharing may be acceptable if the board is properly sanitized and all users have intact skin with no wounds or infections. However, shared use should be limited and temporary—not a substitute for ownership.
This allowance exists for short-term transitions, not long-term practice.
Why is hygiene alone not enough?
A: Safety in Sadhu is not only about cleanliness—it’s about predictability. Familiarity with your own board allows you to distinguish productive discomfort from unsafe sensation.
That awareness cannot develop on rotating equipment.

What’s included in the subscription price?
A: The subscription includes access to:
                                                      * Unlimited Live Online Sadhu Group Classes

                                                      * Structured, guided sessions with clear pacing

This subscription is designed for practitioners who can follow guidance independently and commit to regular practice.
How much do 1:1 Sadhu sessions cost?
A: 1:1 guided Sadhu sessions are $90 USD per 30 minutes.
This pricing reflects individualized attention, real-time adaptation, and higher responsibility on the guide’s side.
What’s the difference in value between group classes and 1:1 sessions?
A:
                                                         * Group classes provide structure and consistency at a lower cost

                                                         * 1:1 sessions provide precision, pacing, and tailored guidance

They are different tools for different needs—not interchangeable experiences.
Is the free trial really free?
A: Yes. The 3 free class pass trial allows full access to classes.
You may cancel at any time during the trial to avoid being charged.
Can I cancel my subscription at any time?
A: Yes. Monthly subscriptions can be canceled at any time before the next billing cycle. Once canceled, access continues until the end of the current billing period.
Annual subscriptions are non-refundable once billed.
Do you offer refunds on subscriptions?
A: No refunds are issued after billing. The free trial exists specifically to ensure informed commitment before payment.
What is your cancellation window for 1:1 sessions?
A: 1:1 sessions must be canceled or rescheduled at least 2 hours before the scheduled start time.
What happens if I cancel within 2 hours or don’t show up?
A: Any 1:1 session canceled within the 2-hour window—or missed entirely—will be forfeited. No refunds or reschedules will be issued.
This policy exists to respect time, preparation, and scheduling integrity.
Why is the cancellation policy strict?
A: 1:1 sessions require:
                                                            * Reserved time

                                                            * Focused preparation

                                                            * Energetic and mental availability

Late cancellations shift that cost unfairly. Boundaries protect the practice.

Results
Score Range: 0–16
Your answers suggest that your nervous system is generally adaptive. You recover from pressure, regulate stress without excessive effort, and your body isn’t carrying a heavy backlog of unresolved tension.
Sadhu practice for you is exploratory, not corrective. It will sharpen awareness, deepen embodiment, and refine your relationship with discomfort—but you’re not operating from depletion.
This is where Sadhu becomes a precision tool, not a necessity.
Best use:
 Occasional practice, skill-building, curiosity-driven sessions.
 
Result 2: Loaded / Transitional Readiness
Score Range: 17–32
Your responses point to accumulated pressure that hasn’t fully discharged. Stress lingers longer than it should, recovery is inconsistent, and certain areas of life or the body are compensating quietly.
You’re functional—but not fully regulated.
Sadhu practice here becomes transitional: it helps your nervous system complete stress cycles instead of carrying them forward. This is where discomfort turns from something you manage into something you metabolize.
Best use:
 Consistent guided sessions, structured entry, nervous-system focused pacing.
 
 
Result 3: High-Load / Corrective Readiness
Score Range: 33–48
Your answers indicate that pressure is no longer situational—it’s patterned. Stress is showing up across multiple areas: body, sleep, relationships, work, or recovery. Stillness may feel difficult, and effort has likely replaced regulation.
This doesn’t mean something is “wrong.”
It means your system has been over-relying on control instead of release.
Sadhu practice here is corrective, not optional. When done properly and safely, it allows the body to process what the mind can’t resolve on its own.
Best use:
 Guided practice, slower entry, emphasis on grounding and completion—not endurance.
