Our Story
Our work began during a period of reassessment. For several years, my focus was almost exclusively on financial performance through futures trading. That focus delivered results for a time, but it also came at a cost. When that chapter ended, it became clear that I had deprioritized important areas of life - relationships, emotional awareness, and long-term direction.
During this period, I also began experiencing persistent anxiety and frequent migraines. The symptoms were disruptive and difficult to ignore. What stood out was not just their intensity, but how closely they tracked with prolonged stress, overexertion, and a lack of regulation.
Concurrently, the decline of my love life highlighted the consequences of self-neglect. Adrift both personally and professionally, my health deteriorated. Sleepless nights became routine, dominated by a constant sense of defeat.  It was in that fragile space that I met Olga - a person who became one of the most meaningful connections in my life. She introduced me to the Sadhu board practice. At first, the idea of willingly standing on nails felt absurd. But her guidance completely changed my life. 
Emotions I had buried surfaced. Old beliefs about my worth unraveled. It was painful - but it was also the first honest confrontation I'd had with myself in years. In that discomfort, I felt something rare: clarity. And with clarity came movement. I started taking real action toward the life I actually wanted - not the one I was performing for the world. Both my mental and physical health improved. After months of insomnia, full night of sleep felt like a return to life. I'll never forget the feeling. 
What I learned is simple: You will never change your circumstances if you avoid facing yourself. And the pain of staying the same is far greater than the temporary discomfort of the nail board.
As I continued researching, practicing, and studying this ancient method, I realized how many people must be silently struggling the way I was - disconnected, overwhelmed, and unsure where to turn. The Sadhu board didn't just transform my inner world; it rebuilt my confidence, my discipline, my emotional resilience, and the way I show up in every relationship.
I knew then that this wasn't something to keep to myself.
This is more than a tool.
It's the beginning of a new chapter - one built on truth, courage, and the belief
that healing is not only possible... it's within reach for everyone.

Why Guidance Matters
Sadhu is a simple practice, but it is not a casual one.
The intensity of the stimulus requires precision, pacing, and structure - especially for those navigating stress, anxiety, or nervous system overload.
Guided practice ensures the experience builds regulation rather than reactivity.
1:1 Guided Sessions - Precision & Personalization
Private sessions are tailored to the individual. This format is ideal for those who want focused attention, gradual progression, and the extra attention to their inner-personal journey. 
Small Group Sessions - Structure & Shared Momentum
Group sessions introduce an added layer of accountability and connection. Practicing alongside others creates a stabilizing environment where individuals are supported by shared intention and presence - without comparison or performance. The collective rhythm of the group often helps participants stay grounded and committed to the practice.
In both formats, practitioners help you:
* Establish correct posture and weight distribution
* Regulate breathing as sensation increases
* Pace exposure to avoid overwhelm or shutdown
* Recognize when to stay, soften, or step off
* Integrate the experience after the session

Without guidance, Sadhu is often approached as an endurance challenge - leading to unnecessary tension, breath holding, or pushing past capacity. This can reinforce stress responses rather than resolve them.
With guidance - whether personal or shared - the practice becomes a method for training presence, stability, and self-trust.
Guidance is not about dependency.
It is about learning the skill correctly, within a structure that supports consistency and growth.









I want to make minor changes to the study cases. Move the sections around so the two study cases are next to each other. Titles kept the same, Autonomic Nervous System Response and The Intervention












Then put the long window as the Conclusion
Conclusion 1
Mechanical punctate stimulation, delivered via Sadhu Boards, offers a powerful, evidence-backed strategy for neuromodulation. The therapy achieved a near 4-in-5 reduction in opioid usage and substantial pain relief, proving it is a critical, scalable alternative for modern pain management.
Conclusion 2
Research has shown substantial effects on cardiac autonomic responses, including reactions of both the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system, influencing self-rated relaxation, blood pressure, heart rate, heart rate variability (HRV), and temperature.
